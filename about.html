        <h1>Known Issues</h1>
        <p>Roller:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marital Status and Secondary Career(s) are linked. Thus, whenever you roll marital status, it will auto-roll secondary careers, and Secondary Career(s) cannot be re-rolled on its own. (The button just doesn't work yet.)</li>
            <li>Several outcomes include dependencies that have yet to be auto-generated. (e.g. The "part-time job" career outcome doesn't just roll a part-time job for you.)</li>
            <li>You have to go to the Rules page to see what the outcomes even mean. (Eventually, you should be able to click the outcome and it will give you a pop up with the details.</li>
            <li>I'm hoping to implement a filter list so you don't have to manually re-roll every time the outcome requires a pack you don't own.</li>
            <li>An export button so you can save your rolls and the rules that go with them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other Issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The site is not responsive to the size of your browser.</li>
        </ul>
