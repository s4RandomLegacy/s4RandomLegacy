        <h2 class="accordion">The Basic Concept</h2>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The Random Legacy Challenge is a 10-generation legacy-style challenge which is defined by its randomly-generated parameters governing careers, types of marriage, number of children, and even more aspects of the game, that each generation must follow. No two Random Legacies are ever the same, and even the luckiest rolls are impossible to plan for more than a generation in advance, due to the fact that each new generation's rolls are only calculated as that generation is born. If formulaic challenge strategy bores you and long-term thinking bogs you down, this is the challenge for you!</p>
            
            <p>There are six categories (designated A-F) that must be rolled for in each generation. The heir should roll for a primary career under category C, and all spouses and helpers should roll for a secondary career under category D. To roll, I recommend you use a site such as random.org, though a full set of tabletop RPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) work well in a pinch if you're creative.</p>
        </div>
        
            
            
        <h2 class="accordion">Getting Started</h2>
        <div class="panel">
        <ol>
        <li> Create a new game. You should not play the random legacy challenge in a world that you've already been playing, it's important to start off with a blank slate.</li>
        
        <li>Set aging to normal and turn aging on for inactive families. If you find a mod that adjusts lifestage lengths, you can use it, as long as the total number of days is roughly the same as you would get under normal aging. Story progression mods, when they emerge, are acceptable to use in order to keep your neighborhood populated, but this challenge will not work with rotation-style play.</li>
        
        <li>Roll generation 1 parameters on tables A, B, C, D(if applicable, once for each spouse and helper), E and F.</li>
        
        <li>Create your founder(and spouse/helpers if applicable) in CAS. You may choose any genders, ages, appearances, traits, aspirations, and family relationships that you want(provided that you're not required to randomize through a parameter), though you may not create any of the children. The only condition is that the heir must be at least a young adult.</li>
        
        <li>Move the family into any empty lot you want. It doesn't matter whether it's blank or it contains a pre-built house. It is recommended that you pay some attention to the neighborhood features(such as fishing or play areas that are accessible without traveling to another lot), but otherwise the choice is up to you. You may pick your own lot traits, if allowed by your starting parameters.</li>
        
        <li>Have fun!</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 class="accordion">Full Rules</h2>
        <div class="panel">
            <ol>
            <li>This challenge runs for 10 generations. You will create the 1st generation in CAS(as described under Getting Started), and the challenge ends when the 10th generation has completed their goals and the 11th generation's heir has come of age.</li>
            
            <li>If you fail any of the parameters(such as by not having enough children, missing the goal, violating a fun objective, and so on), you lose. If you failed because of a game bug or because a sim autonomously rebelled, you don't instantly lose, but you should be careful to avoid sim misbehavior happening in the future. Once or twice in the generation is a mistake, but once or twice a week is too much. If a rule changes mid-legacy, you are not bound by it until your next generation begins, though you may begin abiding by it earlier if you want.</li>
            
            <li>No cheating is allowed! This includes money cheats, skill cheats, relationship cheats, motive cheats, and any mods that give you a clear advantage over another player. In addition, you should avoid exploits and sneaky loopholes in game mechanics. Moving objects around with the player cursor is not considered cheating. Of course, if your game gets into a bugged state, you can do whatever you have to, including cheating, to get it back in a playable state, provided you do your best to erase any benefit you've gained.</li>
            
            <li>During this challenge, heirs, spouses and helpers may only make money from the actions permitted to them under the parameters rolled for that generation, though they may begin doing so as early as childhood. In addition, other sims in the household may not assist them in their careers(such as many sims digging up collectables and giving them to the collector sim to sell), nor can they directly sell efforts from previous generations(planting perfect fruit from a previous generation to get better produce off the bat is okay, a painter selling their hobbyist mother's collection of paintings is not okay). Retiring as an elder is okay, but if you're affected by the bug that gives two pension payments each sim day(you'll know because you get two pop-ups), you must cheat the extra payment away somehow. You can't keep the money.</li>
            
            <li>There are a few money making exceptions, actions which may be done freely. These include: selling childhood drawings made on the activity table, using the NanoCan Touchless Trash Can, and selling duplicate penpal postcards received while collecting. Please do not exploit this allowance, because it's only allowed to relieve tedium associated with tracking and removing so many tiny gains in wealth. Exploits would be things like having all children, regardless of aspiration, spend their entire childhood simply drawing and selling pictures, or having a sim repeatedly take a bite of a plate of food and then scrape what's left into the garbage to “farm” the can.</li>
            
            <li>You may not immediately sell reward objects you receive from promotions and gaining medals for social events, including dates. You may use them in your household, delete them, or banish them to the household inventory. It's not a huge deal if you use them in your household and then delete them some weeks later during a remodeling, especially as you've paid bills on them the entire time, but you should make an effort not to immediately turn around and use them as extra bonus income.</li>
            
            <li>Regarding teen part-time jobs, only heirs and spares who will remain in the household as helpers are allowed to take them. This rule may change if it turns out to be too much, as the game is new and I'm not sure how much income really comes from those, though it looks rather high.</li>
            
            <li>Sims may not be aged up early. You must wait until you get the announcement that it's their birthday and the little bubble shimmers appear on their age bar before you can celebrate their birthday. For babies, you should wait at least until the morning after you get the announcement that it's their birthday(which has always come in the late evening for me, please let me know if it's different for you). In addition, legacy sims must wait the full four days for their pregnancies to come to term – this means no using the pregnancy test, as this shaves up to 24 hours off of the pregnancy timer! You may use the pregnancy test for non-helper spares, such as when doing manual story progression(see #12 below).</li>
            
            <li>Traits and aspirations do not have to be randomly generated, unless you roll that as a parameter. See the Aspirations section below for more information, including help for picking parameter-compatible aspirations for your sims.</li>
            
            <li>The heir may be any sim that you want, provided they were born to or adopted by the previous generation's heir. While children of helpers, provided they are raised in the household, count towards the total number of children for the generation, they are not eligible to become the next heir. If you'd like a little more fun in choosing your heirs, see the Choosing an Heir section below.</li>
            
            <li>The next generation's heir comes of age when they age up to YA. At that point, you are officially in that heir's generation, though restrictions from the previous generation continue to apply until that generation is complete. To complete a generation, all parameter goals must be completed and the next generation's heir must have come of age. Unless stated otherwise, all goals and fun objectives begin when the heir comes of age and end when the heir's generation is complete. Once a generation is complete, sims of that generation(including the heir, spouse and any helpers) may move out, though this is not required to happen immediately. However, all sims of a given generation must have either left this mortal coil or have moved out by the time their grandchildren come of age. For example, a sim who was part of generation 1 may remain in the household until the generation 3 heir comes of age, but at that point they must move out.</li>
            
            <li>Spares must be moved out of the house within 24 hours of aging to YA. You may not play other households in town, including spares, with the exception of briefly taking control only long enough to try for baby and take a pregnancy test, in order to ensure cousins for your legacy family. If you're away from your main household for more than 2-3 sim hours, you're taking too long. Using other methods such as DIY Story Progression is preferred. </li>
            
            <li>You may create spouses and helpers for heirs, but their traits must be randomized and they may not be moved directly into the legacy household. You must first move them into their own home, or with another family, and then have your sim locate them in town and befriend or romance them as required, until they get the option to ask them to move in. It's okay to choose their aspiration, unless it's required to be randomized this generation due to a parameter.</li>
            
            <li>Sometimes the dice just hate you, and doing the same thing multiple generations in a row isn't always fun. If you roll the same career for multiple sims in a generation, or roll the same career, goal or fun in two consecutive generations, you may re-roll that parameter. This does not apply to careers rolled through Career Hopper(only Career Hopper roll itself), and you are not required to re-roll, but the option is there if you'd like to take it.</li>
            
            <li>Aspiration rewards are unrestricted, except for the potions. No potions may be purchased except for the young again potion. To begin, you may only purchase the young again potion once, so make it count. When your generation 6 heir comes of age, you gain a second purchase. This means that if you save your first purchase, at the halfway point you will now have two purchases left.</li>
            
            <li>When moving sims into the family(for spouses or helpers), you may not keep any funds they bring in with them. Use the "testingcheats on" and "money x", where x is the amount you want to set household funds to, to remove any unwanted money that comes along with sims.</li>
            
            <li>While there is a separate career roll to run a retail store, you may operate a retail store to sell your crafted goods as long as you've rolled a career that allows you to sell them normally. This store may only sell those items, however, and such "optional" retail careers don't count as professions for the purposes of rule #18. If you have City Living, operating a vendor table or display wall counts as a retail store for the purposes of both the retail store career roll and "optional" retail careers. However, if you choose to operate one of these vendor tables, it does not count as a profession even if you have rolled the retail career, as due to its portable nature you can set up anywhere.</li>
            
            <li>Some careers have been tagged as "professions" because they require you to switch view to a sim on another loaded lot. These careers are extremely difficult to succeed in if you are attempting to play more than one sim in a profession at a time. Consequently, you may re-roll one(or two, if you've gotten 3 in the same generation) of your profession rolls if this happens.</li>
            
            <li>Concerning clubs, some restrictions must go in place in order to make them non-cheaty:
            <ul>
            <li>Family clubs are okay, but see the next point below.</li>
            <li>Club gatherings should not be constantly active. Gatherings should only be active when club members are actively performing club activities together.</li>
            <li>Club activities should not be mundane tasks that your sims would perform anyway, such as sleeping or cleaning your house. If you want to include these tasks, you must be creative and come up with a way that they could be worked into a gathering, rather than simply being everyday life. For example, a club that meets at a different member's house each week to have a sleepover would be okay, likewise for a club of traveling maids that visits different lots around the neighborhood looking for messes to scour, but a club that meets at your house whenever all the appliances are dirty and cleans them for you would not be okay.</li>
            <li>Crafts(paintings, food, drinks, etc) created during your club gatherings may be consumed, viewed, or otherwise used during the gathering(unless otherwise restricted) but must be thrown away or otherwise deleted without profit immediately after the gathering is over.</li>
            <li>Club activities may not be changed more than once every sim week. Having a club grow with your sims is one thing, but tailoring the club to whatever they have to do on a given day is not allowed.</li>
            </ul></li>
            
            <li>A single wishing well may be purchased and used, but only on your residential lot - if you purchase a wishing well for a community lot, it is for decoration only. You may not wish on it. In addition, certain wishes are limited. You may not wish for Wealth at any time. You may wish for Youthful Vigor, but the wish counts as one of your two young again potion purchases, regardless of outcome! Yes, even if you get aged up, it counts! So, wish carefully. You also may not wish for anything that advances your generation goals. For example, if you have Perfect Careers, you may not wish for Promotion. If you have Perfect Children, they may not wish for Grades or Romance. Wishing for a Child is allowed, and children obtained through that wish count towards your number of children for the generation. However, if you obtain a ghost child, you must turn that child into a real sim in order to complete your number of children goal for that generation.</li>
            
            <li>You may choose your own lot traits when moving into lots, unless otherwise noted, but once they're chosen you may not change them unless directed to by a challenge parameter. Moving house mainly for the purpose of getting to pick better parameters for your current generation is considered cheating. If you're ever in doubt, feel free to determine your lot traits randomly - this will always be okay, even if you move every single generation.</li>
            
            <li>Regarding supernatural sims, so far aliens and vampires appear to be balanced for game play. Feel free to use vampires, aliens, and their associated powers in your random legacy stories, but keep in mind that immortal sims may not remain in the legacy household forever(see rule #11).</li>
            </ol>

        <h2 class="accordion">Aspirations</h2>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I toyed with making the aspirations random, but decided that it was too disruptive(say you rolled a mixologist with the author aspiration, that's just frustrating). However, to make up for getting to choose the aspiration, once that aspiration is chosen you can't switch it out if you get tired of it. If you move in a spouse or helper with a weird aspiration, you can change it once immediately upon moving them in, but then that's what you're stuck with until they complete it.</p>
            <p>Some aspirations require you to make a great deal of money in an area that may not have been rolled for the generation, or may require more children than your sim is allowed to have. To aid in aspiration choice, here's a list of all aspirations listed with the conditions they require in order to be utilized to their full potential.</p>
        
            <h3>Aspirations with no restrictions</h3>

                <li>Creativity(Painter Extraordinaire) – No restriction, may sell only the 3 paintings required for milestone II</li>
                <li>Destination(City Native) - No restriction, may enter contests until you win one for the final step, and if you have rolled Homemade you may eat three(and only three) food stall meals.</li> 
                <li>Deviance(Chief of Mischief) – No restriction</li>
                <li>Fortune(Fabulously Wealthy) – No restriction</li>

        <h2 class="accordion">Choosing an Heir</h2>
        <div class="panel">  
            <p>There're a few more involved methods that you may use to choose an heir, if you want. These include: random chance, succession law, random succession law, random varying succession law and heir vote.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Random Chance: Roll a number between 1 and X, X being the number of children allowed this generation. The number you get is the child who will be your heir.</li>
            
                <li>Succession Law: Pinstar wrote up a list of mix-and-match rules that can be used to define your own succession law, that should be followed for every generation. Do not use the strict eligibility options, as they're not compatible with the limited number of children allowed in this challenge. Merit and Exemplar from the last category might prove troublesome as well, with certain parameters.</li>
            
                <li>Random Succession Law: As above, except roll randomly in each category to determine the law you'll follow.</li>
            
                <li>Varying Random Succession Law: As above, except roll a new succession law as if it was a new parameter each generation.</li>
            
                <li>Heir Vote: If you're blogging your legacy, put your heir choice up as a vote. If you choose this option, you may, if you choose, roll a different set of parameters for each child, as the choice of which to follow will be out of your hands.</li>

You can, on the other hand, keep them to display in your home.</li>

                <li>(Sea) Flower Arranging- Craft flower arrangements to sell. You may sell these via inventory, store, or yard sale table if this is possible. You may have a small garden with flowers only but may not sell the flowers in any way other than through arrangements.</li>

                <li>Perfect Children - All children born this generation must complete their childhood aspiration and receive an B grade in elementary school and an A grade in high school. They should also have a BFF made during childhood, and at least one boyfriend or girlfriend lasting at least 24 sim hours during their teen years.

                <li>Dependable - Your heir, spouse and helpers must complete all daily tasks for school and work, beginning in childhood or upon move-in to the house. You may use vacation days given by the game to skip school or work if you're not going to be able to handle the task, but you may not skip if you have no vacation, or without using your vacation, or attend without having your daily task completed(even if you have saved vacation). Re-roll if no non-profession conventional careers are rolled this generation.</li>
            
                <li>Expansionist - You must construct a significant expansion to the house this generation. You may also add or change a single lot trait, if you wish. If Random is your miscellaneous fun this generation, the trait changed and new trait must be randomly determined.</li>
            
                <li>Collector - Your heir, spouse, helpers and children must complete and display one of the collections. All items must be found or grown that generation, and for plants you may not use seeds from previous generations...find your own! If you already completed part of a collection in a previous generation, you can choose that collection, but you must collect the objects you already have again with a sim from this generation. Collections and display requirements are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Frogs – Anything</li>
                    <li>Gardening – Must be planted and grown to maturity, may be of any quality. May not be grafted into tomato/onion/basil plants to count as all three, you must have one plant for each collectable.</li>

                    <li>Metals – Anything</li>

                </ul></li>
            
                <li>Deadbeat Parents - The heir, spouse and helpers may not help their children this generation, apart from basic needs like food and interaction(autonomous chatting over dinner). This includes helping with homework, mentoring or encouraging children in skills, and reading books to them. For toddlers, it is permitted to provide basic care such as food and diaper changes, but try to avoid any parent-child interactions that raise a skill bar, such as flash cards, reading books, potty training, and so on. Some autonomous talking is okay - the parents are deadbeat, not abusive - but don't deliberately train the communication skill. Children may teach themselves.</li>
                
                <li>Change of Scenery - It's moving time! At some point after the heir comes of age, you must either move to a new lot, or completely demolish the entire house and start over from scratch on your current lot. Your new lot may not share any lot traits with your old lot. If Random is your miscellaneous fun this generation, the new lot's traits must be randomly determined. Re-roll if it's generation 1.</li>
                
                <li>Party King/Party Queen - Host every kind of party(house, dinner, wedding, birthday) with a gold medal in each. If you have more than four party types(through expansions, DLC or mods), roll to randomly determine the four party types that you will be attempting for this goal, re-rolling any duplicates.</li>
                
                <li>Idle Careers - May not make an effort to advance in your heir's, helper's and spouse's careers, including school. If the career goals happen to line up with aspirational goals, that's a happy coincidence, because you may advance in aspiration freely. Autonomous actions are also acceptable. If you've rolled an unconventional career that has no tasks that sims will perform autonomously, you may only perform tasks for it if your sim has a whim to do it or if they do them autonomously.</li>
                
                <li>Friendship is Forever – Beginning when the heir is a child, they must make one new good friend every week. This friendship must be maintained through subsequent weeks, and may only be ended by the death of the friend.</li>
                
                <li>Midlife Crisis - This generation, one of the heir, spouses(including second chances) or helpers will experience a randomly-generated midlife crisis event. Between when this generation is rolled and when the first of the eligible sims reaches the adult lifestage(not YA), determine who will go through the crisis. If you have not picked someone before the first sim reaches adulthood, or is moved in as an adult, that sim will be the one. Once the selected sim reaches adulthood(and not sooner!), roll three times to determine three aspects to the midlife crisis from the chart below, re-rolling if you receive a duplicate. Each aspect has a deadline which it must either be completed or started during. The goal is complete when all aspects have been completed.
                <ol>
                    <li>Re-roll Miscellaneous Fun(complete within 24 hours) - Your Miscellaneous Fun roll will change. It takes effect immediately, with weekly tasks starting the following Sunday.</li>
                    <li>Randomize a trait(complete within 24 hours) - Randomly determine which of your sim's traits will change, then use a cheat to remove that trait, replacing it with another that has been randomly determined.</li>
                    <li>Re-roll Career(complete within 24 hours) - Re-roll your sim's career. This means a new primary career if it's the heir, and a new secondary career if it's a spouse or spare.</li>
                    <li>Make a major purchase(complete within 24 hours) - Buy something shiny and expensive(relative to how much wealth you have) for your house.</li>
                    <li>Have a romantic crisis(start within 48 hours) - Your sim's love life is thrown into turmoil. Perhaps they meet a new lover, cheat on their spouse, or simply have a falling out with a long-time partner. This must begin within 48 hours, but doesn't have to resolve ever.</li>
                    <li>Change style to recapture youth(complete within 24 hours) - Your sim must change their style(mirror and dresser, CAS cheats if necessary) to recapture their youth. Perhaps even get a tattoo. They can change back after a period of a few days if they want.</li>
                    <li>Gain a new skill(complete within 1 week) - Your sim must gain at least 5 skill levels in a skill they haven't used much previously. This counts from the level they're currently at, so if a sim has level 2 charisma, they must attain level 7.</li>
                    <li>Have a child(complete within 1 week) - Your sim must either have a biological child or adopt a child. Either way, it will be raised with the rest of the generation's children. Add one child to the number of children you will have this generation.</li>
                    <li>Randomize Aspiration(complete within 24 hours) - Randomly pick a new aspiration for your sim, throwing out any that are incompatible with your other rolls. If you also have to re-roll your sim's career, use the new career when determining aspiration compatibility.</li>
                </ol></li>
                
                <li>Memorial - The heir, along with any spouses or helpers, must be memorialized this generation, by a sim with maxed skill in the relevant crafting skill(painting, photography or writing). Memorials may consist of: a painted portrait, a photograph, a biography, or a book of life. Each memorial can be crafted by a different sim if you want, and they don't have to all be the same type, though they should all be displayed together.</li>
                
                <li>Themed Display - This generation, the heir, spouses and helpers should create a themed display somewhere in their house or yard. The display must contain at least 10 items, plant and craft level excellent or higher, from at least two different collections or craft disciplines, and must contain at least one craft and one collected item. For example, a display with 3 plants, 5 photographs and 2 space rocks would be okay, but a display with 4 photographs and 6 paintings would not be, because there is no collected item. The theme is left up to you, examples include: space(telescope prints and photographs of the alien home world), botany(plants, photographs of plants, and microscope prints of plants), flowers(plants and paintings of plants in the wild) and animals(frogs, insects and photographs of insects in the wild).</li>
                
                <li>Haunted House - From the time the heir comes of age to the time the heir dies, three sims must die an unnatural death on your home lot. Unnatural death is defined as any death except by old age, and the sims may be members of your household(such as unneeded spouses, spares that are about to move out, or even the heir themselves) or guests. Furthermore, the graves must stay on your home lot, and the ghosts be allowed to roam the house freely. The graves may be removed after this generation's heir dies.</li>
                
                <li>(GT) Best Club Ever - Your heir must start their own club from scratch this generation. To complete this goal, the following criteria must be met concurrently:
                <ul>
                    <li>The club must have 8 members. Sims may not join the club unless they are already friends with the club leader, so get to recruiting!</li>
                    <li>The club must have a hangout built specially for them, either on your home lot or on a community lot. The hangout should contain enough seating for the entire club and any necessary items to complete club activities. If you build on a community lot from the map view, take note of how much money you "spent" on the hangout and subtract it from your family's funds.</li>
                    <li>The club should have all ranks of one of the emotional vibes purchased, depending on the club's focus. Happy counts.</li>
                    <li>The club door perk must be unlocked(since you have a hangout)</li>
                    <li>In addition, three other club spirit perks(hats, jackets, wall decorations, etc) must be unlocked and used.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
                <li>(CL) Domestic Dilemma - When this generation comes of age(or at the start of the game) you must either add a new "negative" trait or replace an existing trait(determine which of the three randomly) with a "negative" trait of your choice(unless you've rolled Random). This generation, you must find a creative way in your story to overcome said negative trait. For example, Quake Zone might be overcome by a sim maxing their writing skill and writing 5 nonfiction bestseller books about earthquake safety, or perhaps by a sim maxing their handiness skill and equipping every appliance/plumbing object in the house with the unbreakable upgrade. Be creative! When the negative trait has been overcome, you may replace it with a trait of your choice if you wish(again, unless you've rolled Random).
                Negative traits include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cursed</li>
                    <li>Filthy</li>
                    <li>Gremlins</li>
                    <li>Grody</li>
                    <li>Haunted</li>
                    <li>Mean Vibe</li>
                    <li>On a Dark Ley Line</li>
                    <li>Quake Zone</li>
                    <li>Vampire Nexus</li>
                </ul></li>

                <li>(P) My Honor Student(s) — In this generation complete every school project in every possible level from poor-excellent and create a prominent display area so that any guests to the house can marvel at your child’s intellect… even if the parent did most of it themselves.</li>

                <li>(C&D) Pet Shrine — Adopt, create, or bring home a stray pet. Through the generation build a shrine to the pet. Example: A wall of Simstigram photos, their urn, favorite toys, collected feathers, collected presents unopened.</li>

                <li>Bad Investment — At the end of the previous generation the former heir made a bad investment and lost most of the families’ money! Add their household funds and lot value then multiply that by 90%. This is the amount you will need to subtract. Once there are no funds left the “repo man” comes. You will need to sell any and all household items until the debt is repaid. You may choose to sell the house and start over if you’d like.</li>

                <li>Bring Me Back To Life — At some point during this generation, one of the family members teen-elder will have a terrible accident… of your choice of course. After Grim has done his duty have the remaining family members work towards having the poor soul rejoin the family and resurrect them. Note: If you won’t have at least one living caretaker left in the house re-roll.</li>

                <li>Do-Gooders — This family’s mantra is doing onto others. And they do! They volunteer together at least once a week. They feed strays in the park. They invite homeless sims to dinner and let them stay the night. They regularly donate to charity. Basically, any do-gooder thing you can think of!</li>

                <li>(S) Holiday Fanatics — Must celebrate at least one holiday each sim week with 5 goals and all completed if possible depending on the sim’s likes. (Thanks ChrissieCSim for the suggestion.)</li>

                <li>(S) Scouting Family- Your family is into scouting. Really into it. Even though the parents can’t be scout leaders they take their children’s involvement seriously. Any badge that can be earned with a parent tagging along they should. Example: Taking the kids to Granite Falls for the nature badge. (Thanks Kris402 for requesting a scout-related goal.)</li>

                <li>(Fame) Rich and Famous- This generation your family is all about the Fame! Everyone in the household must do what they can to gain fame. Once a week they should go somewhere to be seen by their adoring fans and sign autographs, have their picture taken, etc. If they receive gifts they should be set aside in a shrine type area or a dedicated room to display their fame. Duplicate gifts may be deleted but not sold.</li>

                <li>(SV) Doomsday Preppers- At least one member of the family must solve the StrangerVille mystery and it’s aspiration. If you want the entire family can do it. This aspiration can be in addition to your regular one. So if you have a musican doing Musical Genius you can switch back and forth. Optional extra fun: Temporarily move the family to StrangerVille preferably to a bunker style house. You can do this either until the mystery is solved or for the entirety of the generation. You may change the lot traits. When starting the next generation you may choose any lot. You aren’t required to return to the previous legacy lot. You may also stay on your StrangerVille lot. Keep in mind if you choose to stay you can’t move again until rolling the “change of scenery” generational goal. At the start of that next generation you may again choose new lot traits. I’ve added this in case you wanted to temporarily use some of the traits that make things dirty or infested with spiders and such while living in a bunker.</li>

                <li>(IL)- Enviromentalist- Once a week heir must clean up a community lot or venue such as the beach.</li>

                <li>(MS)- Photo Fanatic ( Must take at least 5 photos a week and arrange them either on walls or around the house on tables. Children of heir must have their photo taken at each age stage and pets too.)</li>

                <li>(ROM)- Magic Master- Learn and Master all Spells</li>

                <li>(ROM)- Potion Master- Learn and Master all potions</li>

                <li>(DU)- Career Student- Do at least Two Distinguished Degrees with four classes a term</li>

                <li>(DU)- Bot Crazy- Master the robotics skill, make all bots and a servo and keep in the household for that generation.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="accordion">F) Miscellaneous Fun</h2>
        <div class="panel">
            <ol>
                <li>Random - Determine traits and aspirations(including the childhood aspiration) randomly for all sims of this generation(the heir and their siblings). Adult aspirations should be chosen randomly from the list of aspirations, discarding any which are incompatible with other parameters, as stated earlier in the rules. Helpers and Spouses moved in should have their adult aspiration randomized in a similar manner, if you choose to change it. Any lot traits determined this generation, including initial move-in traits, must be random.</li>
            
                <li>Partier - Throw at least one party(of any type and rating) every week.</li>
            
                <li>Mischief Managed – Your heir must play a successful prank once every week from the time they age into a teen. Pranks include: making a prank call(mischief 3+), clogging drains at other lots(mischief 5+), calling in to play hooky(mischief 6+), sabotaging a rocket ship(mischief 8+), using a stink potion(mental 10+), sabotaging objects and sims(Tormentor reward trait), and any prank options performed with a partner in crime(mischief 4+).</li>
            
                <li>Moody - Once a week, your heir and spouse(if applicable) must spend at least 3 consecutive hours in a certain mood, randomly chosen from the following list: inspired, happy, angry, embarrassed, playful, flirty, sad, bored, dazed, confident, focused, tense, uncomfortable. Heir and spouse may have different required moods.</li>
            
                <li>Homemade - May not get quick meals from the fridge, order pizza, eat from food stalls or dine out, consume plasma packs, and may only cook meals with ingredients if all ingredients are present. The pre-made toddler meals you can serve from the high chair are considered quick meals.</li>
            
                <li>Runs in the Family - Pick a trait from your heir(not a bonus or reward trait). Every child born to your heir must take this trait at the earliest opportunity.</li>
            
                <li>Perfect Attendance – From childhood onwards, your heir and helpers must never be more than one hour late to work or school. Similarly, they may not make use of the leave early function. A five-strike allowance is provided for accidental lateness(like if you queue up actions and don't notice that they didn't leave for work), but intentional lateness for playing strategy or the fifth lateness will result in a loss of the challenge. This restriction also applies to the heir's children and any spouses or helpers moved in later. Perfect attendance also applies to the use of vacation days, either while on vacation or for family leave.</li>
            
                <li>Fixer Upper - May not call the handyman or purchase new objects if they break this generation. You must fix them. I don't care if you have no handiness skill, if you want to shower today you'll get to work, won't you?</li>
            
                <li>Half-Siblings - Sims born this generation must each be with a different partner. Re-roll if you're only having one kid.</li>
            
                <li>Fighter - The heir, spouse or a helper(pick one and stick with it) must get in a fight at least once a week.</li>
            
                <li>Joker - Free re-roll of one category, now or in a future generation.</li>
            
                <li>Health Nut – This generation, sims may only eat healthy food. Healthy food includes: orange juice(quick meal), yogurt(quick meal), garden salad(cooking 1), wellness food, plasma fruit recipes, and your neighbors. In addition, the heir, spouse, helpers, and their children must each spend at least 3 hours each week performing physical activity, such as jogging, swimming, yoga, or playing on the monkeybars.</li>
            
                <li>Gourmet – Once every week, the entire family(heir, spouse, and children) must find the time to sit down all at once and enjoy a gourmet meal prepared especially for the occasion. It doesn't matter whether the heir or the spouse prepares the meal, but it must be from the gourmet cooking skill, not the regular cooking skill.</li>
            
                <li>Hands Off! - You may not use the “hand of god” to clean up books and so on. Sims must clean up on their own. Selling things from their inventory is okay.</li>
            
                <li>Hobbyist – Your heir and spouse(if applicable) must each pick a hobby activity(such as painting, playing chess, jogging, fishing, etc) that is unrelated to their rolled career and devote at least 3 hours every sim week to practicing that activity. They may not use the activity to make money.</li>
            
                <li>My Precious - When your sim finds something they like, it's hard for them to let it go. Pick one of the options below to build a collection over the course of your heir's lifetime. The collection must be displayed somewhere on the legacy lot, so it may not be kept in an inventory, until the generation is complete.
                    <ul>
                        <li> I finds it, it's mine - At least once a week, your sim must go out and find a unique object to add to their collection(pick a single category: frogs, MySims Trophies, metals, crystals, elements, fossils, aliens, space rocks or fish). You may not display duplicates. If you have found one of every item and the generation isn't complete yet, pick a new collection to begin.</li>
                        <li>So bright, so beautiful, my precious - Once a week, your sim must purchase something beautiful and shiny from the decorations tab in buy mode. This should be something that exists only to look awesome, and should be displayed all together(or as trophy centerpieces in each room or something), not decor that "blends in" such as toilet paper rolls in the bathroom or a pan rack in the kitchen. If your sim is insane and decides to build a "bathroom shrine" in their living room, that's totally legit, but it should be done to add to the story, not just because you couldn't be bothered to find a better idea than buying misc decorations for your bathrooms to fulfill this fun.</li>
                    </ul></li>
            
                <li>Vacationer - At least one sim from the household must go on vacation at least once every sim week. If you don't have the OR game pack use the following alternate rule since that sim can't go on an actual vacation. They must use at least one vacation day from work, and must have a day outing of some sort, lasting for most of the day(you know the kind you'd take in real life, leaving after breakfast and arriving back home in the evening), on their day off. This doesn't have to be the same sim every week.</li>
            
                <li>(GT) Clubber - Starting from childhood or the time they join the household, the heir and every spouse/helper must belong to a club, attending a meeting at least once a week. They do not have to belong to the same club, though they can if you want. If you choose to use a household club, please keep in mind the rules about how to avoid making clubs cheaty(#19 under the Rules), specifically the ones prohibiting having a constant club gathering running at all times. They must actually get together in a group and do a thing in order to have a club gathering, you can't just run a gathering while they're all sleeping or doing random tasks around the house.</li>
            
                <li>On Call - Starting when the heir is a teen, they(or a spouse or helper) must respond to at least one "hang-out" phone call every week. This includes birthday parties and invitations to community lots, but does not include requests to come hang out at your home lot - you must actually leave your home lot for this to count.</li>
            
                <li>Town Explorer - Starting when the heir is a teen, they(or a spouse or helper) must visit a unique community lot every week, for at least 3 hours. The community lots may not be repeated to count for this, though you may visit them again just for fun.</li>
            
                <li>(DO) Regular Diner - Once a week, the entire household must go out to eat at a restaurant. All three courses and something to drink should be ordered.</li>
            
                <li>(CL) Festival Frequenter - Every time there is a festival, at least one household member must attend the festival for at least one sim hour. This doesn't have to be the same household member each time.</li>
            
                <li>(CL) Flea Market Fanatic - Some sims just can't pass up a great bargain. Why would you pay full price for anything? This generation, you may not purchase certain categories of items from the catalog. These items may only be purchased from the flea market or from unplayable sims selling their own goods on the street. Paintings left on public easels count.<br>
                    The categories are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comfort  (except beds)</li>
                        <li>Lighting</li>
                        <li>Decorations  (except mirrors)</li>
                    </ul></li>

                    <li>Sibling Rivalry (P) — Whenever the parents aren’t within earshot the siblings can only interact using mean or mischievous interactions until one of them ages to young adult and they patch things up.</li>
                    <li>Rainbow Brite — This generation your heir’s taste drastically changed! Using the design tool in build/buy mode change every item possible to the rolled color. For extra torture, fun dress the entire family in the chosen color as well!
                    1-Red 2-Pink 3-Yellow 4- Green 5- Blue 6- Purple 7- White 8- Gray 9- Black 10- Brown</li>
                    <li>Exchange Student — When one of the children is a teenager they are invited to participate in an exchange program. Pick any other household in the save that has another teenager and swap them in manage worlds. Befriend the exchange student. You can have them stay for only a few days or as long as a week. After they have left invite them to visit once a week and remain friends with at least one family member.</li>
                    <li>(C&D)Foster Pets- From the start of this generation to the time the next generation’s heir takes over you must have a pet in the house that you are actively training daily to encourage someone to adopt it. Once the pet has trained away at least 3 misbehaviors like drinking or rolling in pee puddles and has learned some tricks (if it’s a dog) you will choose a family to “adopt” them via manage worlds. If you won’t have room for a pet see the rule regarding pets. (Credit for this one goes to Onyeka001, thanks!)</li>
                    <li>(JA) Cultured- All family members should max the Selvadoradian culture skill, visit at least twice during this generation to immerse themselves. Optional: Complete the relics collection.</li>
                    <li>(S) Seasonal “Fun”- Each season you must decorate the sim’s house & wardrobe according to the season, as well as do something (like a party or group outing) to celebrate the season. (Credit for this one goes to (Big Mud, thanks!)</li>
                    <li>(GF) Crazed Fans- Your family is all about the rich and famous. At least once a week they should seek out and fawn over the celebrity elite but should not go out of their way to attempt to become famous themselves. If they gain fame inadvertently that’s fine.</li>
                    <li>(IL) Island Local- Once a week must join a island gathering.</li>
                    <li>(ROM) Magic Club- Make a club of Spellcasters who gather to research, make potions and do spells and other things related to magic. Must meet in Glimmerbrook at least once a week.</li>
                    <li>(DU) Secret Society Member- Join and be a practising member of the secret society</li>
                    <li>(DU) Organsation King/Queen- Join an organsation while at uni and be a active member</li>
                    <li>(DU) Roommate fun- have at least 1 roommate in the family household for entire generation</li>
